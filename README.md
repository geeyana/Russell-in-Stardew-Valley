# Russell in Stardew Valley

I made this mod to get started with modifying Stardew Valley and games as a whole. This utilizes Stardew Modding API ([SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)) and [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) to change the game's assets without replacing its files. 

Spritesheet for this comes from [another dog mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20040). I editted the sprites to reflect my dog's characteristics.
