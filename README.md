# Russell-in-Stardew-Valley

This mod replaces the black and white dog with a red bandana. Any other mod that also replaces this dog will cause complications.

Requirements:
- SMAPI
- Content Patcher version 2.0.6 and above

If replacing your first pet:
- After Stardew Valley opens, enter "debug cmenu" onto the SMAPI module to change your pet. 
- Russell does not have his own icon (due to the original dog being a 1.6 update, and its precise icon location from Stardew Valley's files is unknown).
- Choose the black and white dog.
- Changes will save when your game is saved.
